            "description": "This project compared reinforcement learning algorithms (SARSA, Expected SARSA, Q-Learning, and Double Q-Learning) for autonomous glider soaring using thermal energy. A Python Gym environment simulated a point glider, and each algorithm was trained and compared to identify the optimal one. The project demonstrated reinforcement learning's potential for enabling gliders to harness thermal energy and stay aloft, with applications in aerial surveillance, environmental monitoring, and recreational flying."

I improved camera drivers for personal systems and developed a video background blur project using deep learning techniques in Python and Keras. This project achieved real-time background blur in live camera streams, separating foreground and background, and demonstrated potential applications in video conferencing and surveillance without the use of any third party application like zoom."
