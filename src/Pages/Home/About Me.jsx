                <p className="hero--section-description">As an AI supporter and tech enthusiast, I'm eager to learn more about using computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning to help advance society and bring about positive changes. With a curiosity-driven approach, I explore the latest developments in AI and seek opportunities to apply cutting-edge techniques to real-world problems.</p>
                <p className="hero--section-description">I've had the privilege of working at HP Inc., where I witnessed the practical application of computer vision firsthand, which helped me understand the concept from the ground up. This experience has motivated me to pursue a career in this field, with the goal of improving human lives and making them more convenient. Additionally, my time at Tata Consultancy Services enabled me to develop a strong foundation in Python, which has ultimately facilitated my transition into the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
                <p className="hero--section-description">Backed off of these experience, I am currently involved in teaching and mentoring students at The Ohio State University. Specifically, I serve as a Lab Teaching Assistant and Grader for ECE 2050: Introduction to Discrete Time Signals and Systems, within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. This role enables me to continuously learn and grow.</p>
